# STATA

Sample STATA code to study the impact of Syrian immigration on Turkish Native labor market outcomes. The file uses a 1% sample of the 
Turkish Household Labor Force Survey. The [sample do file](https://github.com/oruc47/syrian_immigration_labor_market_impact/blob/24acb5d91572d81d4cc194b3c3bb961935603cd9/sample.do) goes over the 
following process:
- Difference-in-Difference without the use of a package
- Difference-in-Difference across multiple regions and time and continous variables
- STATA cluster options
- Bootstrapping
- Instrument Variable Analysis
- Placebo Analysis
- Synthetic Control


# Python

The sample [python file](https://github.com/oruc47/tubitak_price_dispersion/blob/db37ad86fdb838c00784c92d96ec448eb8baf199/price_dispersion_analysis.py) contains the object code to clean data, calculate the statistics to be used in analyze, and include Matplot code to display results. 


# C++
